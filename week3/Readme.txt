Hi,
My name is Xiaonan Liu,
for this week's assignment we focus on javaScript;
for me, I have some experience in java(I keep practicing every day?),c++ and c,so it is easy for me to finger out the
algorithms,but the syntax seems strange for me, so I spend a lot of time on checking all the syntax and rules.

My work focus on
(1) set a promp to ask for the visitor's name, and capitalize the first character and make other lower case, then show
  on the top middle for the website, if there is no name, it will only show "welcome"
(2)I design a button for user to try the add two numbers, when your first click it, the program will show,
if you click twice, it will close
(3) allow user to input two numbers, you can input integer or float, but I only keep two decimals for the result
(4) the add bottom, when you click, it will call "getNum()" function, and given the result
    also, if the result is greater than 10, below will show the text "this is a big number",
    otherwise, it will show"this is a small number";
(5) it also has a button names "try again", if people want to try again, the tryAgain() function will clear out all
    the inputs and clear all the output, to let user try form start
(6) it also has the button names"goodbye", this allows people to click on and hidden this program, instead it will
 show" Thanks for using this program!"

(7) to challenge myself and learn more about javascript, I try to implement a calculator in my assignments,
 and I think it works fine, and the css for the calculator takes a lot of time, but finally, I make it just look like
 the calculator in the phone.
