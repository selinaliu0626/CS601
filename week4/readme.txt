Hi,Josh:
    My name is Xiaonan Liu.
    This week we focus on the form validation.
    There are two ways to check the validation:
       you could use js and write the function to check it, and also you could use "pattern " to define the valid input.
       I use both for my program.
        (1) In text area, the name and facilitator: I use "patter" to define the valid input.

        (2) For Radio button and checkbox I use js method to check has user given the valid input. And I also use variables to
        hold the value we have input, in case we need to use sometime.

        (3)when use pattern validation, we could set reminder instead of default,
        for example: oninvalid="setCustomValidity('Please enter valid alphabets and the length is at least 2 ')"
        but I found pattern is not stable, sometimes when you correct them it still reminder you,your input is not right.

        (4) for radio button and checkbox, I set an area for show the message to reminder user choose the answer,and the message will be red.

        (5) I also design some simple css for this assignment,to make my website more beautiful. And also I have
        check on validator, to make sure everything works well.


        ps: Because I live in WA, so your live class for saturday is a little earlier for me, but I watch record every time,
        and thanks for your good explanation for assignments and show examples for us, just feel  sorry when I hear
        you say to one of our classmates" Except you two, I have no other people to talk to".
        Best
        Xiaonan Liu
